This form is not for reporting a location that you can not find from the search box.

Use this form to help us rename airports, points of interest and other data provided from the API (rarely updated) to a better name. For example the airport in Broomfield colorado was renamed from "Jeffco" in the API to "Rocky Mountain Metro" it's new name.

You can also make a pull request on the `[station-overrides.mjs](https://github.com/netbymatt/ws4kp/blob/main/datagenerators/stations-states.mjs)` file which includes instructions on how to make the change directly. This is the preferred method.
